# Coding standard — TypeScript

Read before writing or changing TypeScript.

Applies whenever the project contains TypeScript code.

### Baseline

- TypeScript strict mode.
- Target ES2022 (revisit per the universal *Versions and targets* rule).
- Module system: ESM. `verbatimModuleSyntax` on. Include the `.js` extension in import specifiers (TS rewrites correctly, ESM at runtime needs it).
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`, `isolatedModules` all on.

### Formatter settings (Biome)

- Indentation: **2 spaces**.
- Line width: 100.
- Quotes: single.
- Semicolons: as needed (Biome's `asNeeded`).
- Trailing commas: all.

### Naming

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| File | `kebab-case.ts` | `interval-set.ts`, `measurer.ts` |
| Test file (co-located) | `kebab-case.test.ts` | `timer.test.ts` |
| Class / interface / type / enum | `PascalCase` | `Measurer`, `EngagementMetrics` |
| Function / method / variable | `camelCase` | `createMeasurer`, `readingRatio` |
| Module-level constant (semantic value) | `camelCase` | `defaultConfig` |
| Compile-time / pure constant | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `DEFAULT_READING_SPEED` |
| Private class field | `#camelCase` (the JS private syntax) | `#remaining`, `#listeners` |

### Type rules

- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes.
- Use `type` for unions, intersections, mapped types, and aliases that aren't purely object shapes.
- Mark properties `readonly` whenever they are not reassigned after construction.
- Avoid `any`. Use `unknown` when the type is unknown and narrow at the boundary.
- Use the `satisfies` operator to verify a literal against a type without widening it.
- Prefer literal/template literal types and discriminated unions over enum-style flags.

### Type-checking

Bun strips types at runtime — it does not type-check. Enforce the type system via a separate `tsc --noEmit` pass, run in CI and in the lefthook pre-commit / pre-push hooks. Treat `tsc --noEmit` as a build step, not an editor convenience.

### Module rules

- **Named exports only.** No default exports anywhere.
- Each package has a single `index.ts` that re-exports the public API.
- Add-on packages depend on the core via `peerDependencies`, never `dependencies`.
- The core package has zero runtime dependencies in browser libraries designed for distribution.

### Class rules

- Private members use the `#` syntax, not the `private` keyword. `#` is enforced by the runtime; `private` only by the type checker.
- Constructor parameters typed and `readonly` where applicable.
- Getters for derived state; setters only when the class genuinely owns mutable state.
- Side effects in constructors limited to what's required to satisfy invariants. Long-running setup goes in a separate `start()` / `init()` method.

### Function rules

- Pure where possible. Side effects pushed to the edges.
- Single responsibility. ~30 lines is a soft guideline, not a hard cap.
- Early returns to flatten nesting.
- More than three parameters: take an options object.
- DOM event listeners use `{ passive: true }` whenever applicable.

### Doc comments

Every public symbol carries a JSDoc/TSDoc block. The type system shows the shape — the comment explains the contract, the why, and the non-obvious cases.

```ts
/**
 * Recalibrate the timer with a new duration, preserving current progress.
 *
 * If progress is 60% and the new duration is 10 s, remaining becomes 4 s.
 *
 * @param newDurationSeconds - New estimated reading time in seconds.
 */
recalibrate(newDurationSeconds: number): void { … }
```

### Standalone scripts

A single-file TypeScript script runs on Bun with the env-based shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bun`. Keep it self-contained by pinning an exact version in the import specifier — `import { x } from "pkg@1.2.3";` (no `^` / `~` ranges); Bun installs it on first run. Packaging shape (command-style in `bin/` vs internal) follows the universal *Standalone-script packaging* rules in the general module.

### TypeScript project structure (library / monorepo)

```
project/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/                 ← Zero-dependency core package
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   ├── index.ts      ← Public API, re-exports only
│   │   │   ├── iife.ts       ← IIFE entry for <script src="…"> use
│   │   │   ├── <feature>.ts

│   └── <addon>/              ← Add-ons depend on core via peerDependencies
│       └── …
├── docs/                     ← Architecture, algorithm, conventions, …
├── tests/                    ← Cross-package and e2e (Playwright)
├── agents.d/                 ← Kntnt coding standard (coding-standard/<module>.md)
├── AGENTS.md                 ← References point to agents.d/

├── tsconfig.json
└── package.json              ← Workspaces, scripts
```

Tests are **co-located** with source (`timer.ts` + `timer.test.ts` in the same folder). Cross-package and end-to-end tests live in `/tests` at the repo root.

### TypeScript and JavaScript tooling

- **Bun** as package manager, bundler, test runner, and runtime where the project is browser-side and standalone. WordPress plugins use the WordPress build pipeline (`@wordpress/scripts`) only when the plugin needs Gutenberg block integration; otherwise plain Bun + Biome.
- **TypeScript** for any non-trivial JavaScript code. Plain JavaScript is acceptable only where TypeScript adds friction without value (e.g. small WordPress admin scripts loaded via `wp_enqueue_script` — see the *JavaScript (browser, no TypeScript)* rules).
- **Biome** as the single linter and formatter (replaces ESLint and Prettier).
- **happy-dom** for DOM mocking in unit tests where Bun's runner does not cover the surface natively. Faster than jsdom.
- **Playwright** for end-to-end browser tests. Headless Chromium is the default browser.
- **Lefthook** for git hooks (format, lint, type-check on commit; full test suite on push to `main`).

### Tools deliberately not used

The default toolchain above replaces ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Husky, npm, pnpm, yarn, Webpack, and Rollup. Not forbidden, but a specific project need is required to bring any of them in.
